                <p><b>Current Status: 4th Semester</b></p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at Sindh Madressatul Islam University, City Campus, Karachi, where I am in my 4th semester with a CGPA of 3.4 out of 4.0. My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in various programming languages, including C, Java, Python, and Assembly Language. I have applied these skills through several projects, such as developing a Banking Management System in Python using Tkinter GUI, creating a menu chart in Assembly Language with TASM 1.4, and implementing a Library Management System in Java with NetBeans IDE. Additionally, I designed a BMI software in C and completed a Digital Logic Design project with an Arduino Uno SMD chip to control LED lights.</p>
                <p>Beyond technical skills, I have also developed strong communication and presentation abilities through a dedicated course. For this course, I worked on a project that involved covering a mall and conducting interviews, which enhanced my confidence and capability in public speaking. I continue to engage in various coding projects and assignments that challenge me and contribute to my growth in the field of computer science.</p>
